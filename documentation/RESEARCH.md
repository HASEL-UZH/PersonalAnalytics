# PersonalAnalytics for Researchers

This project was created by and for researchers who want to ask study participants to run PersonalAnalytics on their device to non-intrusively collect computer interaction data in a privacy-protected way. As often times, having access to only automatically collected data is often not sufficient, PersonalAnalytics also offers an experience sampling component, which allows researchers to ask users to reflect and self-report on one or several questions (e.g. Have I been productive? Am I stressed right now?) at customizable times and using Likert-scales. As all collected data is only stored locally on participants' computers, there is an export component, guiding the participant through sharing and potentially obfuscating the captured data, before sharing it with the researchers through their data transfer service of choice. Most settings are configurable in the study-config, everything else can be customized in code.


# Customizing PersonalAnalytics
To customize PersonalAnalytics for your research study, please consider the following steps:

1. Fork the project to work in your own repository.
2. Update the [study configuration-file](../src/electron/shared/study.config.ts) (`study.config.ts`) with your custom study-related settings (see details below). Hereby, you can add your custom study name, study title, privacy policy, export upload url as well as contact data. In addition, you can customize which computer interaction tracker isrunning, and if you want to prompt the user to self-report on one or several questions in the experience sampling component.
3. (optional) If you require further customizations, you can create them in the code (see [Contributions Guide](#contributions-guide)).  
4. Use Github Actions (see [build.yml](https://github.com/HASEL-UZH/PersonalAnalytics/blob/feature/electron/.github/workflows/build.yml)) to build and deploy PersonalAnalytics and allow your participants to use it. Using the method, PersonalAnalytics can automatically update your participants' installations with new releases

The `text` property is the question that the participant should answer. The `scale` property describe the labels of the scale that the participant should use to answer the question.                                                         | ✅               |                           |

The same order as defined for the `questions` applies.                                                                       | ✅               |                           |
