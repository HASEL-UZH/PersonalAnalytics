Thank you for helping me out with my project! All you will need to do is run a program on your computer while you work and it will collect the window titles you used 
Throughout your work session. 

Task Switching:

You need to track when you are switching tasks. To make this easier for you, create a .txt file and name it "SWITCHING_TASKS". 
Everytime you switch tasks, simply open that file then close it.

Steps:

1. Clone the masters branch of this repo

2. Open AM.PA.MonitoringTool.sln in an IDE (It works well with Visual Studio). To find the file, go to the PersonalAnalytics folder in your File Explorer.
   Then go to src -> client -> AM.PA.MonitoringTool and it will be there.
   
3. Once in your IDE, open the folder titled WindowsActivityTracker and open DayWindowTitleList.

4. In the function writeToFile (the first function), add the file path that you will use to save the data (modify line 35). The program will create the file for you when it runs. 
   This file will be used to save all of your window titles. Make sure it is a .txt file. 

5. Run the code by pressing start

6. Go about your work day. When you are done, click on the system tray button (bottom right on the task bar) -> right click on the Personal Analytics logo (white portrait of a man) -> Click show retrospection. 
   Then you may end the program by pressing stop.

7. That's it! You may now send me the .txt file you created at step 3 at pgousse@student.ubc.ca

Thanks again!
